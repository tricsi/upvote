# js13kVote
Vote by comparing two randomly selected games with each other, then move on to the next pair.

## Details of "1vs1 battle"

You will be presented with two random games to compare and decide which one of them is better in given criteria: Innovation, Fun, Theme, Gameplay, Graphics, Audio, and Controls. You can also mark any of them as a tie. If you end up comparing two Mobile category entries, you will see an extra criterion for how well the games perform on mobile devices.

Only those who submitted a game are allowed to vote. Be aware that we need as many votes as possible to end up with solid results, so please vote for at least 20-30 pairs, but ideally all 102 of them. You won't be allowed to vote for your own game, and for the same games twice though.
